# ATEM_Control_Blackmagic_Pocket


#scope
- To allow the person carrying the mobile camera to fully focus on the perspective and walking, we want to enable the lighting to be controlled remotely by the director.
- The whole setup needs to work wirelessly, of course.
- The system should activate itself automatically and be ready at all times.
- The system should be robust enough that you don't have to worry about the order of operations, etc. — the key is to make it foolproof.
- The hardware for the system should not cost more than approximately €150.
- Every piece of code must be documented so that others can work on it in the future.
- It would be great if we could complete this in 4 weeks before you move away.
